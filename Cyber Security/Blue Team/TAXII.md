Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII) is an application protocol for exchanging CTI over HTTPS. ​TAXII defines a RESTful API (a set of services and message exchanges) and a set of requirements for TAXII Clients and Servers. As depicted below, TAXII defines two primary services to support a variety of common sharing models:

- **Collection** - A Collection is an interface to a logical repository of CTI objects provided by a TAXII Server that allows a producer to host a set of CTI data that can be requested by consumers: TAXII Clients and Servers exchange information in a request-response model.
    
- **Channel** - Maintained by a TAXII Server, a Channel allows producers to push data to many consumers and consumers to receive data from many producers: TAXII Clients exchange information with other TAXII Clients in a publish-subscribe model. Note: The TAXII 2.1 specification reserves the keywords required for Channels but does not specify Channel services. Channels and their services will be defined in a later version of TAXII.
