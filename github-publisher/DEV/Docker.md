### Overview  
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables us to separate our applications from our infrastructure so we can deliver software quickly. With Docker, we can manage our infrastructure in the same ways we manage our applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, we can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
