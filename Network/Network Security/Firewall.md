Firewalls are essential network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Here's a comprehensive cheat sheet on firewalls:
### Types of Firewalls

1. **Packet Filtering Firewalls**
   - Operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
   - Filters packets based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
   - Examples: iptables (Linux), Windows Firewall (Windows).

2. **Stateful Inspection Firewalls**
   - Tracks the state of active connections.
   - Allows or denies packets based on the context of the connection.
   - Examples: Cisco ASA, Palo Alto Networks firewall.

3. **Proxy Firewalls**
   - Acts as an intermediary between internal and external networks.
   - Inspects traffic at the application layer (Layer 7).
   - Examples: Squid Proxy, Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs).

4. **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)**
   - Combines traditional firewall features with advanced functionalities.
   - Includes intrusion prevention (IPS), application awareness, and SSL inspection.
   - Examples: Fortinet FortiGate, Cisco Firepower.

### Firewall Rules

- **Allow Rules**: Permit specified traffic based on defined criteria.
- **Deny Rules**: Block specified traffic based on defined criteria.
- **Implicit Deny**: Default rule to deny all traffic that doesn’t match any allow rule.

### Common Firewall Rules

1. **Basic Allow Rule**
- Allow inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP):
 ```
 Allow TCP/80 from any to any
 ```

2. **Allow Specific IP Address**
- Allow inbound traffic from a specific IP address:
 ```
 Allow TCP/22 from 192.168.1.100 to any
 ```

3. **Deny Rule**
- Deny outbound traffic to a specific IP address:
 ```
 Deny TCP/443 from any to 203.0.113.10
 ```

### Firewall Zones

- **Internal Zone**: Trusted network segment (e.g., LAN).
- **External Zone**: Untrusted network segment (e.g., Internet).
- **[[DMZ]] (Demilitarized Zone)**: Semi-trusted network segment for hosting public-facing services.

### Firewall Configuration and Management

- **Configuration Management**: Define and update firewall rulesets.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Monitor firewall logs for security events and anomalies.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct security audits to review firewall configurations and rules.

### Best Practices

- **Default Deny**: Implement a default deny rule to block all traffic by default.
- **Least Privilege**: Apply the principle of least privilege to firewall rules.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep firewall firmware and rule sets up-to-date.
- **Segmentation**: Use network segmentation to isolate critical assets.
- **Testing**: Test firewall rules and configurations regularly.

### Firewall Testing Tools

- **[[Nmap]]**: Port scanning and network discovery tool.
- [[Wireshark]]: Network protocol analyzer for packet inspection.
- **Metasploit**: Penetration testing framework for testing firewall vulnerabilities.

### Regulatory Compliance

- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation.

### Troubleshooting Firewall Issues

- **Check Logs**: Review firewall logs for denied traffic.
- **Rule Evaluation**: Verify rule precedence and order.
- **Network Testing**: Use testing tools to verify connectivity.
