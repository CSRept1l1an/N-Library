## What Is LDAP?

**LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** is an open, vendor-neutral application protocol for accessing and maintaining directory services over a network. LDAP allows applications to query and manage directory information, such as user credentials, organizational data, and network resources, in a structured and efficient manner.

### Key Features:
- **Protocol:** LDAP is a protocol defining communication methods with directory services rather than a specific directory service implementation.
- **Vendor-Neutral:** LDAP is compatible with various directory service implementations like Microsoft Active Directory, OpenLDAP, and Novell eDirectory.
- **Data Characteristics:**
  - **Descriptive:** Stores detailed attributes about entities (e.g., users, printers, groups).
  - **Static:** Data changes infrequently but is critical for business functions.
  - **Valuable:** Frequently accessed for authentication, authorization, and information retrieval.

### Common Use Cases:
- Centralized authentication and authorization.
- Contact information storage (e.g., company directories).
- Managing network resources like printers and shared drives.

## The LDAP Process Explained

### LDAP Query Process:
1. **Session Connection:** The client connects to the LDAP server using a designated port (typically 389 for LDAP or 636 for LDAPS).
2. **Request:** The client sends a request (e.g., to search for a user's email) to the LDAP server.
3. **Processing:** The LDAP server processes the request by querying its directory and retrieving the relevant data.
4. **Response:** The server sends the response back to the client with the requested information.
5. **Completion:** The client disconnects from the server once the interaction is complete.

### Authentication Methods:
- **Simple Authentication:** Requires a username and password for access. The credentials are sent in clear text unless encrypted.
- **Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL):** Provides a framework for authentication with additional security mechanisms, such as Kerberos, which enhances security beyond simple username/password methods.

### Security:
- **Transport Layer Security (TLS):** Encrypts the data transmitted between the LDAP client and server to protect sensitive information. LDAP over TLS is often referred to as LDAPS.

### LDAP Operations:
- **Add:** Create a new entry in the directory. Example command: `ldapadd -x -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W -f new_entry.ldif`.
- **Delete:** Remove an existing entry from the directory. Example command: `ldapdelete -x -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W "cn=user,dc=example,dc=com"`.
- **Search:** Retrieve specific entries from the directory based on search criteria. Example command: `ldapsearch -x -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W -b "dc=example,dc=com" "(uid=jdoe)"`.
- **Compare:** Check if an entry matches a specified attribute value. Example command: `ldapcompare -x -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W "cn=user,dc=example,dc=com" "userPassword=password"`.
- **Modify:** Update attributes of an existing entry. Example command: `ldapmodify -x -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W -f modify_entry.ldif`.

## LDAP Terms to Understand

- **Data Models:** Defines how data is structured in the directory (e.g., object classes, attributes).
  - **Object Class:** Defines the types of objects (e.g., person, group) and their attributes.
  - **Attribute:** Provides specific details about an object (e.g., emailAddress, phoneNumber).
- **Distinguished Name (DN):** A unique name that identifies an entry in the directory, representing its path through the hierarchy. Example: `cn=John Doe,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`.
- **Modifications:** Changes made to directory entries, including:
  - **Add:** Adding a new attribute or entry.
  - **Delete:** Removing an attribute or entry.
  - **Replace:** Replacing an existing attribute value.
  - **Increase:** Incrementing numerical values.
- **Relative Distinguished Name (RDN):** The portion of the DN that identifies an entry relative to its parent. Example: `cn=John Doe` in the DN `cn=John Doe,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`.
- **Schema:** Defines the rules and constraints for the directory data, including object classes and attributes.
- **URLs:** Include server address, port, and operation details. Example: `ldap://ldap.example.com:389/`.
- **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):** Identifies resources using a specific format. Example: `ldap://ldap.example.com/dc=example,dc=com`.

### Additional LDAP Concepts:
- **Referral:** A mechanism for redirecting LDAP requests to another server if the requested information is not available on the current server.
- **Alias:** A reference to another entry, often used to simplify access to commonly used entries.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Define permissions for accessing and modifying directory entries, enhancing security and control.

LDAP's flexibility and extensive documentation make it a valuable tool for managing directory information across various systems and applications.
