## Second-Order SQL Injection

Second-order SQL injection occurs when malicious input is initially stored in a database and later used in a different SQL query. This happens when an application stores user input during one request and uses it in a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping in a subsequent request.

**Example Scenario:**
1. **Initial Input Storage:**
   - User inputs: `Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--`
   - Application stores this input in the database without sanitization.
   
2. **Subsequent Query:**
   - Later, the application uses this stored input in another SQL query, leading to SQL injection when it executes the stored malicious payload.

**Mitigation:**
- Always sanitize and validate user input at every point of entry.
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements.
- Regularly audit code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Automated SQL Injection Tools

### Sqlmap
Sqlmap is an open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws. It supports a wide range of databases and provides various features for database fingerprinting, data retrieval, and more.

**Key Features:**
- Extensive database support (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.).
- Database fingerprinting.
- Data extraction.
- Various injection techniques (boolean-based, time-based, etc.).
- Integration with other tools (Burp Suite, etc.).

**Usage Example:**
```bash
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --dbs
```

### Havij
Havij is a commercial automated SQL injection tool with a user-friendly GUI. It simplifies the process of exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities and extracting data.

**Key Features:**
- Easy-to-use interface.
- Database fingerprinting.
- Data extraction.
- Supports various SQL injection techniques.
- Visual representation of data.

**Usage:**
- Input the target URL.
- Select the type of SQL injection.
- Click "Analyze" to start the injection process.

### jSQL Injection
jSQL Injection is an open-source Java-based tool for automatic SQL injection. It supports various database management systems and provides a user-friendly interface.

**Key Features:**
- Supports multiple databases.
- Data retrieval.
- Automatic detection of injection points.
- GUI and command-line interface.

**Usage Example:**
```bash
java -jar jsql-injection-vX.X.jar
```

## Database Fingerprinting and Enumeration

### Identifying the Database Type
Database fingerprinting is the process of identifying the type and version of the database being used by the web application. This information is crucial for crafting targeted SQL injection attacks.

**Techniques:**
- Error-based SQL injection: Analyze database error messages.
- Time-based blind SQL injection: Use specific database functions and observe the response time.
- Banner grabbing: Some databases expose version information in banners or metadata.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT @@version; -- For MySQL
SELECT version(); -- For PostgreSQL
SELECT @@version; -- For SQL Server
```

### Enumerating Database Schema and Contents
Once the database type is identified, the next step is to enumerate the database schema and extract data.

**Techniques:**
- UNION-based SQL injection: Retrieve data by combining results with legitimate queries.
- Error-based SQL injection: Extract data through error messages.
- Blind SQL injection: Use conditional responses to infer data.

**Examples:**
- **MySQL:**
  ```sql
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='database_name';
  SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='table_name';
  ```

- **PostgreSQL:**
  ```sql
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public';
  SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='table_name';
  ```

- **SQL Server:**
  ```sql
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables;
  SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='table_name';
  ```
