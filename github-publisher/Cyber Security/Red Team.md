# OWASP Top 10  
  
## 1. Injection  
- Description: Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.  
- Example: SQL Injection  
  
## 2. Broken Authentication  
- Description: Broken authentication occurs when attackers compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens to gain unauthorized access to users' accounts.  
- Example: Brute Force Attacks  
  
## 3. Sensitive Data Exposure  
- Description: Sensitive data exposure happens when applications fail to adequately protect sensitive data such as financial, healthcare, or personal information.  
- Example: Insecure Cryptographic Storage  
  
## 4. XML External Entities (XXE)  
- Description: XXE occurs when an application processes XML input from untrusted sources which can lead to remote code execution, sensitive data disclosure, and server-side request forgery (SSRF).  
- Example: XXE Attack  
  
## 5. Broken Access Control  
- Description: Broken access control vulnerabilities allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to functionality and data.  
- Example: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)  
  
## 6. Security Misconfiguration  
- Description: Security misconfiguration occurs when security settings are incomplete, out of date, or default, which can expose sensitive data, infrastructure vulnerabilities, or provide unauthorized access.  
- Example: Default Credentials  
  
## 7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- Description: XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.  
- Example: Reflected XSS  
  
## 8. Insecure Deserialization  
- Description: Insecure deserialization occurs when untrusted data is used to abuse the logic of an application, leading to remote code execution, access control bypass, or denial of service attacks.  
- Example: Remote Code Execution  
  
## 9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities  
- Description: Using components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software, with known vulnerabilities can expose the application to security risks.  
- Example: Outdated Dependencies  
  
## 10. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring  
- Description: Insufficient logging and monitoring make it difficult to detect security incidents or breaches, allowing attackers to maintain persistence and evade detection.  
- Example: Lack of Monitoring for Suspicious Activities
