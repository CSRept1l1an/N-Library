### 1. Introduction to Web Servers

#### Definition
A web server is software that handles HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests from clients (usually web browsers) and serves HTTP responses, typically in the form of web pages. It manages the communication between the client and the server, including handling requests, processing them, and sending back responses.
