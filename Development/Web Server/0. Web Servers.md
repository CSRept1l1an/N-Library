### 1. Introduction to Web Servers

#### Definition
A web server is software that handles HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests from clients (usually web browsers) and serves HTTP responses, typically in the form of web pages. It manages the communication between the client and the server, including handling requests, processing them, and sending back responses.

#### Common Web Servers

1. **[[Apache|Apache HTTP Server (Apache)]]**
   - **Overview**: One of the most popular and widely used web servers. It is known for its flexibility and extensive feature set.
   - **Features**:
     - Modular architecture with support for various modules.
     - Comprehensive configuration options.
     - Support for .htaccess for directory-level configuration.
   - **Common Use Cases**: Hosting websites, web applications, and as a proxy server.

2. **[[Nginx]]**
   - **Overview**: A high-performance web server known for its speed and efficiency. It can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache.
   - **Features**:
     - Event-driven architecture for handling a large number of concurrent connections.
     - Lightweight and efficient in handling static content.
     - Built-in support for reverse proxy and load balancing.
   - **Common Use Cases**: High-traffic websites, content delivery networks (CDNs), and as a front-end proxy for applications.

3. **[[IIS|Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)]]**
   - **Overview**: A web server developed by Microsoft for Windows Server. It integrates tightly with other Microsoft products and services.
   - **Features**:
     - GUI-based management through IIS Manager.
     - Support for ASP.NET and integration with the .NET framework.
     - Advanced security features and support for authentication mechanisms.
   - **Common Use Cases**: Hosting .NET applications, enterprise environments, and integration with Microsoft technologies.

4. **LiteSpeed**
   - **Overview**: A commercial web server with a free open-source version (OpenLiteSpeed). It is known for its high performance and scalability.
   - **Features**:
     - Built-in caching for improved performance.
     - Support for HTTP/2 and QUIC.
     - User-friendly interface for configuration.
   - **Common Use Cases**: High-performance web hosting, particularly where speed and scalability are critical.

5. **[[Tomcat]]**
    - **Overview**: A web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation, primarily for running Java-based applications.
    - **Features**:
        - Supports Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications.
        - Integrated with Apache web server for enhanced functionality.
        - Good for running Java-based web applications.
    - **Common Use Cases**: Hosting Java web applications, enterprise environments requiring Java EE support.

### 2. Basic Concepts

#### HTTP/HTTPS

- **[[HTTP|HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)]]**
  - **Overview**: The foundational protocol used for transferring data over the web. It operates on top of TCP/IP and is designed for exchanging information between web servers and clients.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Stateless: Each request is independent; the server does not retain information between requests.
    - Plain text: Data is transmitted in plain text, which may expose sensitive information.
  - **Ports**: Typically uses port 80.

- **[[HTTPS|HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)]]**
  - **Overview**: An extension of HTTP that adds a layer of security by using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data transmitted between the client and the server.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Secure: Encrypts data to protect against eavesdropping and tampering.
    - Authentication: Verifies the identity of the server using certificates.
    - Integrity: Ensures that data is not altered during transmission.
  - **Ports**: Typically uses port 443.

#### Request Methods

- **GET**
  - **Purpose**: Requests data from a specified resource.
  - **Usage**: Used for retrieving data from the server. Data is sent in the URL query string.
  - **Characteristics**: Safe and idempotent (repeated requests have the same effect).

- **POST**
  - **Purpose**: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
  - **Usage**: Used for sending data to the server, such as form submissions. Data is sent in the body of the request.
  - **Characteristics**: Not idempotent (repeated requests may have different effects).

- **PUT**
  - **Purpose**: Updates a specified resource with new data.
  - **Usage**: Used for updating existing resources or creating new ones if they do not exist. Data is sent in the body of the request.
  - **Characteristics**: Idempotent (repeated requests have the same effect).

- **DELETE**
  - **Purpose**: Deletes a specified resource.
  - **Usage**: Used for removing resources from the server. No data is typically sent in the body.
  - **Characteristics**: Idempotent (repeated requests have the same effect).

- **HEAD**
  - **Purpose**: Retrieves the headers of a specified resource.
  - **Usage**: Used for obtaining metadata about a resource without downloading the resource itself.
  - **Characteristics**: Safe and idempotent.

- **OPTIONS**
  - **Purpose**: Describes the communication options for the target resource.
  - **Usage**: Used for querying the server about the supported methods and capabilities for a resource.
  - **Characteristics**: Safe and idempotent.

#### Status Codes

- **200 OK**
  - **Meaning**: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource.
  - **Usage**: Indicates that the server successfully processed the request.

- **301 Moved Permanently**
  - **Meaning**: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
  - **Usage**: Used for URL redirection; browsers will automatically update the URL to the new location.

- **404 Not Found**
  - **Meaning**: The server could not find the requested resource.
  - **Usage**: Indicates that the resource is not available at the requested URL.

- **500 Internal Server Error**
  - **Meaning**: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
  - **Usage**: Indicates a server-side problem that needs to be addressed by the server administrator.
