### Types of Programming Languages

#### 1. Interpreted Languages
- **Execution**: Code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime.
- **Advantages**:
  - Easier to debug and test since errors can be detected and fixed in real-time.
  - Highly portable across different platforms without recompilation.
  - Often used for scripting and rapid development due to their flexibility.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Typically slower execution speed compared to compiled languages.
  - Can be less efficient in terms of resource usage.
- **Examples**: [[Development/Programming/Python/Python|Python]], JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.

#### 2. Compiled Languages
- **Execution**: Code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution.
- **Advantages**:
  - Faster execution speed since the code is already in machine language.
  - Often more optimized, leading to better performance and resource usage.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Compilation step adds time to the development process.
  - Less flexibility for making quick changes compared to interpreted languages.
- **Examples**: C, [[C++]], Rust, Go.

#### 3. Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiled Languages
- **Execution**: Combines aspects of both interpreted and compiled languages. Code is compiled into intermediate code, which is then compiled into machine code at runtime.
- **Advantages**:
  - Balance between execution speed and flexibility.
  - Can optimize code at runtime for better performance.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Initial startup time can be slower due to the compilation step at runtime.
  - More complex implementation compared to purely interpreted or compiled languages.
- **Examples**: [[Java]], C# (using .NET CLR).

#### 4. Scripting Languages
- **Execution**: Typically interpreted, used for writing small programs (scripts) to automate tasks.
- **Advantages**:
  - Easy to write and execute with minimal setup.
  - Great for automating repetitive tasks and enhancing productivity.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Generally not suitable for large-scale applications due to performance limitations.
- **Examples**: Bash, Perl, PowerShell.

#### 5. Markup Languages
- **Execution**: Not executed in the traditional sense, but parsed and rendered to display formatted text and data.
- **Advantages**:
  - Ideal for defining the structure and presentation of data.
  - Easy to learn and use for creating web pages and documents.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited in functionality compared to traditional programming languages.
- **Examples**: HTML, XML.

#### 6. Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)
- **Execution**: Can be interpreted or compiled, designed to solve problems in specific domains.
- **Advantages**:
  - Highly efficient and expressive for their specific use cases.
  - Simplifies development within the domain by providing tailored features and syntax.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited applicability outside their specific domain.
  - Often require learning a new syntax and set of rules.
- **Examples**: [[SQL]] (database queries), VHDL (hardware description).

#### 7. Functional Languages
- **Execution**: Can be interpreted or compiled, based on mathematical functions.
- **Advantages**:
  - Emphasize immutability and pure functions, leading to more predictable and maintainable code.
  - Often facilitate concurrent programming due to lack of side-effects.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can have a steeper learning curve due to different paradigms and concepts.
  - Performance can vary based on the implementation and use cases.
- **Examples**: Haskell, Erlang, F#.
