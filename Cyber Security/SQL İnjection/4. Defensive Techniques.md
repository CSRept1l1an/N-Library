## Input Validation and Sanitization

Proper input validation and sanitization are crucial to preventing SQL injection attacks. These techniques ensure that user input is treated safely and cannot be used to execute malicious SQL commands.

### Parameterized Queries
Parameterized queries use placeholders for parameters and bind user input to these parameters. This ensures that user input is treated as data and not executable code.

**Example in Java (using JDBC):**
```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
pstmt.setString(1, username);
pstmt.setString(2, password);
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
```

**Example in Python (using SQLite):**
```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?", (username, password))
rows = cursor.fetchall()
```

### Prepared Statements
Prepared statements are similar to parameterized queries but are precompiled by the database. This provides additional performance benefits and ensures that user input is handled securely.

**Example in Java (using JDBC):**
```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
pstmt.setString(1, username);
pstmt.setString(2, password);
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
```

**Example in Python (using Psycopg2 for PostgreSQL):**
```python
import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=test user=postgres password=secret")
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s", (username, password))
rows = cur.fetchall()
```

### Stored Procedures
Stored procedures are precompiled SQL code stored in the database. They can encapsulate complex logic and reduce the risk of SQL injection by separating user input from SQL code.

**Example in SQL Server:**
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetUser
    @Username NVARCHAR(50),
    @Password NVARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = @Username AND password = @Password;
END
```

## Web Application Firewalls (WAF)

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP requests for malicious activity. WAFs can detect and block SQL injection attacks and other web threats.

### ModSecurity
ModSecurity is an open-source WAF that integrates with various web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx). It provides a robust set of rules to detect and prevent SQL injection and other web attacks.

**Basic Setup with Apache:**
1. **Install ModSecurity:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-security2
   ```

2. **Enable ModSecurity:**
   ```bash
   sudo a2enmod security2
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

3. **Configure ModSecurity:**
   Edit the `modsecurity.conf` file to set up the basic configuration and enable the core rule set (CRS).

## Security Best Practices

### Principle of Least Privilege
Grant the minimum necessary permissions to users and applications to reduce the risk of exploitation. For example, a web application should not have administrative access to the database.

**Example:**
- Create a database user with limited privileges:
  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'webapp'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON mydatabase.* TO 'webapp'@'localhost';
  ```

### Regular Audits and Code Reviews
Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and fix vulnerabilities. This includes:
- Reviewing code for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Auditing database access controls.
- Testing web applications using automated tools and manual penetration testing.

**Tools:**
- **Static Code Analysis:** Tools like SonarQube, Checkmarx.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
- **Penetration Testing:** Regularly test applications for security vulnerabilities.
