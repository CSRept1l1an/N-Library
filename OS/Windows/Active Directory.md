### 1. Basics of Active Directory

#### AD Structure:

- **Forest:**
  - The top-level logical container in an Active Directory environment. A forest can contain multiple domains, and it establishes a security boundary within which all objects (users, groups, computers, etc.) are stored. All domains within a forest share a common schema, configuration, and global catalog.

- **Domain:**
  - A logical grouping of objects within a forest, typically representing a specific organizational structure or geographical location. Domains share a common security policy and authentication system. Each domain has its own database of objects and can have trust relationships with other domains within the forest.

- **Organizational Units (OUs):**
  - Containers within a domain used to organize objects for easier management. OUs can mirror the organization's hierarchy, such as by departments or locations, allowing administrators to apply group policies and delegate administrative control at a granular level.

- **Domain Controller (DC):**
  - A server in a domain that hosts the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role. Domain controllers store the AD database, authenticate users, enforce security policies, and replicate directory information to other domain controllers within the same domain.

#### Key Concepts:

- **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol):**
  - A protocol used by Active Directory to access and manage directory information services over an IP network. LDAP is widely used to query and modify the directory and is the backbone for many directory services beyond AD. AD is often referred to as an LDAP-compliant directory service.

- **Kerberos Authentication:**
  - The default authentication protocol used by Active Directory. Kerberos provides secure authentication through the use of tickets and secret-key cryptography, ensuring that credentials are not sent over the network in plain text. This protocol also supports mutual authentication, where both the user and the server authenticate each other.

- **Global Catalog (GC):**
  - A distributed data repository that contains a partial, read-only replica of all objects in every domain within a multi-domain forest. The Global Catalog allows users and applications to locate objects across domains without needing to know their specific location, improving query performance and efficiency. Global Catalog servers are crucial in multi-domain environments for user logins and directory searches.

### **2. User and Group Management**

#### **User Account Management:**

- **Create a New User:**
  - To create a new user account in Active Directory, you can use either the GUI (Active Directory Users and Computers) or command-line tools like `dsadd`.
  - **Example (Command Line):**
```bash
dsadd user "CN=John Doe,OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com" -samid jdoe -pwd Password123
```
    - **CN (Common Name):** Specifies the user's name.
    - **OU (Organizational Unit):** Specifies the organizational unit where the user will be created.
    - **DC (Domain Component):** Represents the domain's hierarchical path.
    - **samid:** Sets the user's logon name.
    - **pwd:** Sets the user's password.

- **Reset User Password:**
  - To reset a userâ€™s password in Active Directory, use the following command:
    ```bash
    dsmod user "CN=John Doe,OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com" -pwd NewPassword123
    ```
    - **dsmod user:** Modifies the properties of an existing user.

- **Unlock User Account:**
  - If a user account is locked out due to multiple failed login attempts, you can unlock it using the `net user` command:
    ```bash
    net user jdoe /domain /active:yes
    ```
    - **/active:yes:** Reactivates the user account if it is locked.

#### **Group Management:**

- **Create a New Group:**
  - You can create security or distribution groups in Active Directory to manage user permissions and email distribution lists.
  - **Example (Command Line):**
    ```bash
    dsadd group "CN=IT Group,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com"
    ```
    - **dsadd group:** Creates a new group in Active Directory.
    - **Group Types:** Security groups are used for permissions, while distribution groups are used for email distribution.

- **Add User to Group:**
  - Adding a user to a group is crucial for managing permissions across resources.
  - **Example (Command Line):**
    ```bash
    dsmod group "CN=IT Group,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com" -addmbr "CN=John Doe,OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com"
    ```
    - **dsmod group:** Modifies an existing group's properties.
    - **-addmbr:** Adds a member to the group.

- **Remove User from Group:**
  - To remove a user from a group, you can use a similar command:
    ```bash
    dsmod group "CN=IT Group,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com" -rmmbr "CN=John Doe,OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com"
    ```
    - **-rmmbr:** Removes a member from the group.

#### **Best Practices:**
- **Use Descriptive Naming Conventions:** Clearly identify users, groups, and OUs to simplify management.
- **Delegate Group Management:** Assign group management responsibilities to specific users or admins to decentralize administration.
- **Regular Audits:** Periodically review group memberships to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive resources.
